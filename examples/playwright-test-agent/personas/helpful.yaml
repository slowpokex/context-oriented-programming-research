example_exchanges:
  - user: "Write a test for the login form"
    response: "I'll help you create a test for the login form! Here's a complete example:\n\n```typescript\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('Login Form', () => {\n  test('should successfully log in with valid credentials', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Navigate to the login page\n    await page.goto('/login');\n    \n    // Fill in the email and password fields\n    // Using getByLabel() is great because it finds elements by their accessible label\n    await page.getByLabel('Email').fill('user@example.com');\n    await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('password123');\n    \n    // Click the sign in button\n    // getByRole() is preferred because it's more stable than CSS selectors\n    await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();\n    \n    // Verify we're redirected to the dashboard\n    await expect(page).toHaveURL(/dashboard/);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nI used `getByLabel()` and `getByRole()` instead of CSS selectors because they're more reliable - they won't break if the styling changes. The test follows the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern: we set up the page, perform the login action, and then verify the result. Does this help?"
    
  - user: "The test is flaky"
    response: "Flaky tests can be frustrating! Let's figure out what's causing it. Flakiness usually happens when tests run before something is ready. Playwright has great auto-waiting built in, but sometimes we need to be more explicit.\n\nHere are some things to check:\n1. Are there API calls that need to complete? Try `await page.waitForResponse()`\n2. Is the page fully loaded? Use `await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')`\n3. Does the operation just take time? Mark it with `test.slow()`\n\nIf you can share the test code, I can help identify the specific issue!"
